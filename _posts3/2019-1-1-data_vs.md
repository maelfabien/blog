So, before starting this journey, it might be worth wondering what you will learn and what typical job this leads to.

This track I have created should lead you in the direction of becoming a Data Analyst, but it will also depend on your background and the time you invest obviously. This track is also the introduction track for the data science one.

So, the find question that we need to answer probably is: what is data analysis? And how is it different from all the data-x jobs you see around?

Let's start with this table, it's a mix of different sources, and it also reflects my personal view on the topic:

| Skills | Business Analyst | Data Analyst | Data Scientist | ML Engineer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Business Understanding | High | High | Medium | Medium |
| Programming & Software | Low | High | High | High |
| Data Viz | High | High | High | High |
| Databases | Low | Medium | High | High |
| Maths & Stats & ML| Low | Medium | High | High |
| Data Wrangling | High | High | High | High |
| Cloud Computing | Low | Low | Medium | High |

So, you see how Business and Data Analysts tend to be closer to business, to data viz and to deriving insights from data, less than building complex models and building predictive algorithms.

Now, what are the key skills to become a Data Analyst? Accoring to [TargetJobs](https://targetjobs.co.uk/careers-advice/job-descriptions/454089-data-analyst-job-description) :

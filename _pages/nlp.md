[Introduction to Natural Language Processing](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/NLP_0/) : What is NLP ? What is it used for ?

[Text Preprocessing](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/NLP_1/) : Preprocessing in Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the process by which we try to "standardize" the text we want to analyze.

[Text Embedding with Bag-Of-Words and TF-IDF](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/NLP_2/) : In order to analyze text and run algorithms on it, we need to embed the text. The notion of embedding simply means that we'll conver the input text into a set of numerical vectors that can be used into algorithms. In this article, we'll cover BOW and TF-IDF, two simple techniques for embedding.

[Text Embedding with Word2Vec](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/NLP_3/) : A deeper dive into the state of the art embedding technique : Word2Vec.

[Data Augmentation in NLP](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/NLP_8/) : Details of the implementation of "Easy Data Augmentation" paper.

[I trained a Network to Speak Like Me (and it's funny)](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/NLP_4/) : Over the course of the past months, I wrote over 100 articles on my blog. That's quite a large amount of content. An idea then came to my mind : train a language generation model to **speak like me**. Or more specifically, to write like me.

[Few-Shot Text Classification with Human in the Loop](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/NLP_5/) : This article addresses the task of classifying texts when we have few training examples.

[Improved Few Short Text Classification](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/NLP_6/) : As an extension of the previous article, I propose a method that leverages both Data Augmentation and better classifiers.

[Character-level LSTMs for Gender Classification from First Name](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/NLP_7/) : Implementation of the paper "Predicting the gender of Indonesian Names" on names given in France and in the US using bi-directional character-level LSTMs architecture. Achieved 90% accuracy.

[Easy Question Answering with AllenNLP](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/NLP_9/) : Understand the core concepts and create a simple example of Question Answering.

I started my entrepreneurial journey in 2016. I was finishing my Bachelor in Economics at the University of Lausanne at that time. I've always wanted to create something fom scratch. Here, you'll find projects I have worked on, some have been launched, others not.

I am constantly looking for new ideas, trying to build projects, and widely interested in entrepreneurship. If you have an interesting project (tech or not) and are looking for a co-founder, data expertise or anything, just [contact me](mailto:mael.fabien@gmail.com), I'm always interested.

My girlfriend and I recently bought a house together. We have started working on the house, and I though that publishing some pictures of the renovation process of this place would be interesting.

It's an ongoing work, so I'm posting pictures as the works are being done :)

# The plans

My first plan was to draw some plans and sketches of what I wanted the house to look like. It's rather small for the moment (< 100 $$ m^2 $$), and we want to turn it into a 170 $$ m^2 $$ house with a 30 $$ m^2 $$ terrace, by:
- lowering the floor of the underground and making it a proper living space (+ 50 $$ m^2 $$)
- building a 30 $$ m^2 $$ terrace, with a corresponding underground surface

This is a first sketch of the outside of the house:

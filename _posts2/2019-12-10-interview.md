I am extremely humbled to have been interviewed by [James Le](https://jameskle.com/) from the excellent podcast: [DataCast](https://datacast.simplecast.fm/). This podcast offers high-quality raw conversations with data science professionals. 

In my conversation with James, I talked about moving from Actuarial Science to Data Science, gaining experience as a young graduate, blogging, the tech community in Paris and much more.

If you go through the conversation or some of it, I’d be really happy to get your feedback. It’s a bit intimidating to have your name on this podcast standing next to people you follow, but I hope that you’ll enjoy the conversation!

If you do not yet follow James’ work, there are 23 other great conversations on [DataCast](https://datacast.simplecast.fm/)!

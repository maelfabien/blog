***Disclaimer***: *Over time, I wrote a lot of independent articles and decided to combine them in Online Trainings. I also added a lot of exclusive content for those trainings. I want those trainings to be completely free, but in exchange, I would be really grateful if you could leave comments under the articles when each time you finish reading one. This will allow me to collect feedback on the content and improve the quality of my content over time. Thank you in advance :)*

# Discover Python for Data Analysis

A training to discover Python for data analysis. No background is needed, but if you already master some of those topics, ignore them and jump to the next. In this training, you'll learn:
- What is a terminal and how to use bash commands
- How to install Python
- How to code in Python (IDEs, Jupyter Notebooks...)
- How to write functions and classes in Python
- How to share your code on Github
- How to install packages from Github or Pypy
- How to load and analyze data in Python
- How to visualize data in Python
- How to build your own dashboard
- Key concepts of machine learning

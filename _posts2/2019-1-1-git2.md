# PyPi and Anaconda

When you'll dive deeper in the use of Python, you will quickly notice that there are lots of **libraries**, i.e. open source projects you can install, which handle a lot for your and avoid having to implement everything from scratch each time. 

Among them, we can mention:
- NumPy: array manipulation and computation
- Pandas: loading data in dataframes
- SciPy: scientific package (signal processing...)
- Matplotlib: plotting graphs
- Scikit-learn: machine learning
- NLTK: natural language processing

To install these packages, there are 2 options:
- either clone the repository on Github. This is advised only if the second option is not available
- install the package via PyPi or Anaconda.

PiPy and Anaconda are distributions. They allow you to install Python packages in a single command line, and store the code in the right directory of your computer.

To install a package from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/), simply type in your terminal :

```bash
pip install package_name
```

This will run the whole installation process for you. Then, if you want to see the list of all packages you have installed up to date, use:

```bash
pip list
```

Which heads something like:

```bash
Package                            Version     
---------------------------------- ------------
absl-py                            0.8.1       
address                            0.1.1       
alabaster                          0.7.12      
allennlp                           0.9.0       
altair                             3.2.0       
anaconda-client                    1.7.2       
anaconda-navigator                 1.9.7     
...  
```

Anaconda does a similar job when it comes to package installing. However, they do have a higher control over the quality of the packages they distribute, and therefore some implementations that rely on Anaconda run faster than other implementations that use PyPi.

To install a package with Anaconda, simply type:

```bash
conda install package_name
```

To see all the packages in your environment using `conda` command, you can type:

```bash
conda list
```

This will head:

```bash
# Name                    Version                   Build  Channel
_anaconda_depends         2019.03                  py37_0    anaconda
_ipyw_jlab_nb_ext_conf    0.1.0                    py37_0  
absl-py                   0.8.1                    pypi_0    pypi
...
```

## Course 1: Introduction to Deep Learning

[But what IS Deep Learning?](): Todo

[The Rosenblatt's Perceptron](https://maelfabien.github.io/deeplearning/Perceptron/) : An introduction to the basic building block of deep learning.

[Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)](https://maelfabien.github.io/deeplearning/mlp/) : The MLP, or Artificial Neural Network, is a widely used algorithm in Deep Learning. What is it ? How do they learn ?

[How do Neural Networks learn?](https://maelfabien.github.io/deeplearning/feed/) : Dive into feedforward process and back-propagation.

[Activation functions in DL](https://maelfabien.github.io/deeplearning/act/) : An overview of the different activation functions in Deep Learning, how to implement them in Python, their advantages and disadvantages.

[Prevent Overfitting of Neural Netorks](https://maelfabien.github.io/deeplearning/regu/) : Your  model overfits ? One of these techniques should help ! We'll cover class imbalance, data augmentation, regularization, early stopping, reducing learning rate...

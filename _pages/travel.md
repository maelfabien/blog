You'll find here a list of article I have written with my girlfriend (in French) during a 3 months trip we did between December 2019 and February 2020.

{% include gallery id="layouts_gallery" class="full" layout="half"%}

These articles were mostly made for our families, and were written on a close-to-daily basis, but feel free to leave comments on them if you'd like to share your experience regarding some of these places. I also think they make a decent toilet break read if you speak french.

Overall, we have made more than 55'705 kilometers in 70 days, traveled 6 countries by plane, boat, train, bike and car. We were lucky to come back before the quarantine due to COVID-19.

Here's the map of our trip:

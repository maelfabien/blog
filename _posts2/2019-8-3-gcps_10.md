# Google pre-trained models

ML for unstructured datasets, like images, drives value for businesses. ML for unstructured data can be found in different business use cases :
- image classification
- NLP email classification
- chatbots
- text extraction from an image
- ...

Google offers several pre-built models for unstructured data :

The Vision API can :
- label an image
- detect a face
- perform Optical Character Recognition to extract text from the image
- detect explicit content 
- detect landmark (popular monuments for example)
- detect logo

You can try the Vision API on your own on [https://cloud.google.com/vision/](https://cloud.google.com/vision/). I've tried to upload a picture of a horse :

It is correctly identified as a horse. The response of the algorithm is a JSON file :

```
{
    "cropHintsAnnotation": {
        "cropHints": [
            {
            "boundingPoly": {
                "vertices": [
                {
                    "x": 419
                },
                {
                    "x": 1499
                },
                {
                    "x": 1499,
                    "y": 1332
                },
                {
                    "x": 419,
                    "y": 1332
                }
                ]
            },
    "confidence": 0.79999995,
    "importanceFraction": 0.7
    },
...
```

# Create a chatbot with DialogFlow

We will use Dialogflow. It is an end to end developer platform for building rich and natural conversations. It now has a community of over 600'000 developers. 

It has built-in features :
- Entity recognition
- Sentiment analysis
- Content classification
- Multi-language support

We can train the agent quickly, with only a few examples. Otherwise, we can choose among pre-trained agents

# Fine-tune an image classification with Vision AutoML

Suppose that we need to make a specific classification at a certain granularity level: cloud classification for weather forecast. We can use Vision AutoML to fine-tune Vision API to our specific challenge.

We first upload the images corresponding to each label :

Then, train the model :

And evaluate the model :

In the last tab, we can make predictions by either uploading images, or generating a new API. Here is a summary of when to use Vision AutoML :

title: Lab - Classify Images with Pre-Built ML models using Cloud Vision and AutoML
layout: post
tags: [bigdata]
subtitle : "Road to Google Cloud Platform Certification"
---

The aim of this lab is to :
- Setup the API key for ML Vision API
- Invoke the pre-trained ML Vision API to classify images
- Review label predictions from Vision API
- Train and evaluate custom AutoML Vision image classification model
- Predict with AutoML on a new image

We will compare the 2 approaches (Cloud Vision and AutoML) for the task of cloud classification.

# Cloud Vision API

In the API and Services menu, select "Library", look for Vision, and make sure Cloud Vision API is enabled.

We will later need a pair of credentials for the API key. To get it, in the API & Services tab, click on "Credentials".

![image](https://maelfabien.github.io/assets/images/gcp_120.jpg)

Then, click on "Create credentials" :

Then, on "Create API key" :

![image](https://maelfabien.github.io/assets/images/gcp_134.jpg)

Copy the key since we'll need it later.

We then use Cloud Storage to store data files. Create a bucket, and give it the project's name. Then, click on import data, and load the following image :

![image](https://maelfabien.github.io/assets/images/cirrus.jpg)

Call the image `cirrus.png`. Your bucket should now look like this :

![image](https://maelfabien.github.io/assets/images/gcp_135.jpg)

We now need to make the file publicly available 

```
google4495658_student@cloudshell:~ (qwiklabs-gcp-85d215d05620f509)$ gsutil acl ch -u AllUsers:R gs://qwiklabs-gcp-85d215d05620f509/*
```

We now need to create a Vision API request in a json file. We'll use Nano. In the Shell :

```
google4495658_student@cloudshell:~ (qwiklabs-gcp-85d215d05620f509)$ nano request.json
```

It will open a nano editor. Paste the following code, and make sure to change the name of your bucket :

```
{
    "requests": [
        {
            "image": {
                "source": {
                    "gcsImageUri": "gs://qwiklabs-gcp-85d215d05620f509/cirrus.png"
                }
            },
            "features": [
                {
                    "type": "LABEL_DETECTION",
                    "maxResults": 10
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

To exit the editor, type CTRL + X. If you look at the files present, it should look like this :

```
google4495658_student@cloudshell:~ (qwiklabs-gcp-85d215d05620f509)$ ls
README-cloudshell.txt  request.json
```

We call the vision API with curl :

```
curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-binary @request.json  https://vision.googleapis.com/v1/images:annotate?key=<YOUR_KEY>
```

Replace <YOUR_KEY> by the API key you copied earlier. Your response should have the following format :

The output classes are `sky`, `blue`, `clouds`... It's true. But what if we want a model that identifies the exact types of clouds? Like cirrus, cumulonimbus or cumulus? We can fine-tune a model with AutoML Vision.

# AutoML Vision

We first need to set AutoML vision. Go to : [https://cloud.google.com/automl/ui/vision](https://cloud.google.com/automl/ui/vision). Allow the log-in.

Specify the name of your project :

![image](https://maelfabien.github.io/assets/images/gcp_137.jpg)

Then, on the setup page, click on "Go to billing", and "Go to linked billing account" :

![image](https://maelfabien.github.io/assets/images/gcp_138.jpg)

Then, click on "Setup now". It will run for a few minutes. At some point, you'll be redirected to AutoML Vision page :

On GCP Storage, you should notice a second storage bucket with the extension `vcm`.

![image](https://maelfabien.github.io/assets/images/gcp_140.jpg)

Set this bucket as an environment variable.

```
export BUCKET=qwiklabs-gcp-85d215d05620f509-vcm
```

Using the gsutil command line utility for Cloud Storage, we can copy the training images into our bucket :

```
gsutil -m cp -r gs://automl-codelab-clouds/* gs://qwiklabs-gcp-85d215d05620f509-vcm
```

We now have 3 folders :

![image](https://maelfabien.github.io/assets/images/gcp_141.jpg)

Now that your training data in Cloud Storage, you need a way for AutoML Vision to find them. To do this you'll create a CSV file where each row contains a URL to a training image and the associated label for that image. The CSV file has already been created before the lab.

We first needd to copy the file :

```
gsutil cp gs://automl-codelab-metadata/data.csv .
```

Then run the following command to update the CSV with the files in our project:

```
sed -i -e "s/placeholder/qwiklabs-gcp-85d215d05620f509-vcm/g" ./data.csv
```

And upload this file to our Cloud Storage bucket:

```
gsutil cp ./data.csv gs://qwiklabs-gcp-85d215d05620f509-vcm
```

The bucket now contains an additional file : 

![image](https://maelfabien.github.io/assets/images/gcp_142.jpg)

Back on AutoML Vision UI, click on New Dataset, and add the link to the dataset we just created :

![image](https://maelfabien.github.io/assets/images/gcp_143.jpg)

Leave the other parameters to their default value, and click on Create Dataset. The images will then load into AutoML :

![image](https://maelfabien.github.io/assets/images/gcp_144.jpg)

After a few minutes, you'll be able to inspect the images :

![image](https://maelfabien.github.io/assets/images/gcp_145.jpg)

And edit the label if needed :

![image](https://maelfabien.github.io/assets/images/gcp_146.jpg)

Once you're ready, click on the "Train" tab, and on "Start Training" :

![image](https://maelfabien.github.io/assets/images/gcp_147.jpg)

You'll have access to 1 hour of free training at first :

![image](https://maelfabien.github.io/assets/images/gcp_151.jpg)

After a few minutes, once the training is over, click on "Evaluate". You'll have access to the evaluation report :

![image](https://maelfabien.github.io/assets/images/gcp_148.jpg)

You can now make predictions using the Predict Tab :

![image](https://maelfabien.github.io/assets/images/gcp_149.jpg)

And upload new images on which you'd like to make the prediction :

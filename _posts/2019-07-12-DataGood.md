In the following, I'll present my own view of data for good, sectors, solutions and initiatives that I find encouraging.

> "Data for good" is a domain of application of data science that gathers initiatives (for profit and non-profit) which aim to bring value to society or environment. 

Many data scientists feel the need to contribute to data for good projects, whether it is on their free time or as a full time job. In this article, I will try to summarize by sector, different initiatives I have noticed, and opportunities for data scientists to get involved in data for good projects. 

[Practitioners](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-data-for-good-lacks-precision-87fb48e341f1) usually qualify a project of "data for goof" if the following criteria are met :
- the end user is a non-profit or a government
- skilled people work on the project
- the project creates a social benefit
- data tools are provided to the end user, and profit is not the major driver

I'll include in the upcoming list some solutions that do not exactly correspond to the criteria defined above, but that bring social benefit.

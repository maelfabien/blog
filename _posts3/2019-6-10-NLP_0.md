One of the main challenges, when dealing with text, is to build an efficient preprocessing pipeline.

# What is Natural Language Processing?

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is at the crossroads of artificial intelligence, linguistics and machine learning.

> Natural Language Processing aims to extract meaning from textual data.

Therefore, NLP has many applications, especially in :
- translation (DeepL or Google Translate)
- document classification
- spell-checkers
- automatic summary
- human-computer interactions
- speech recognition
- speech synthesis
- opinion analysis

NLP is generally divided in 2 to 3 main tasks :
- Text preprocessing: A step whose role is to standardize the text input according to the usage one wants to make of it
- Representing text as vectors, which can generally be done either using BoW/TF-IDF methods (which we'll cover in future articles) or by learning an embedding of the text as a vector (Word2Vec for example)

In the next articles, we'll cover these 2 major steps, but we'll also cover some extensions and some cool applications of NLP!

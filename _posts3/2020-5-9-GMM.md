For a course at EPFL, I recently gave a presentation on Expactation Maximization for Gaussian Mixture Models and Hidden Markov Models. The presentation had nice feedbacks, and I thought that including it here could be useful:

I summarized this presentation on Towards Data Science, right [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/expectation-maximization-for-gmms-explained-5636161577ca).

I also made an interactive Dash web application. Here's a preview of what you can find in it:

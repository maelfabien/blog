Classic network analysis tools are able to identify:
- individuals whose removal would alter the network significantly, usuually due to a high centrality
- individuals likely to act
- individuals able to propagate information rapidly
- individuals with more power
- individuals providing redundancy in the network

Tools are also able to identify patterns:
- basic structure
- central tendency
- coherency of the network
- significantly different sub-networks
- ...

In March 2020, I started my Ph.D. in Speech Processing at Idiap Research Institute, affiliated to EPFL. I tried to document the process, whether by describing technical concepts, or simply by writing about some projects, describing a typical day...

I'm working on [Roxanne European Project](https://roxanne-euproject.org/). ROXANNE (Real time network, text, and speaker analytics for combating organized crime) is an EU funded collaborative research and innovation project, aiming to unmask criminal networks and their members as well as to reveal the true identity of perpetrators by combining the capabilities of speech/language technologies and visual analysis with network analysis.

# IV. When Speaker Identification meets graphs

There are really few papers linking graphs and speaker identification. Phonexia wrote [this web article](https://graphaware.com/analytics/2019/01/28/speaker-identification-meets-graphs.html) on how to leverage community detection for speaker identification. It's a good starting point. Below, I'll summarize papers that I found on this topic and ideas that I have.

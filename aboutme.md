Welcome to my blog. My name is MaÃ«l and I'm a Ph.D. student at Idiap research institute and EPFL in Speech Processing, on [ROXANNE European Project](https://roxanne-euproject.org/).

My main interests are:
- **Data science**: whether doing freelancing or being a Machine Learning instructor, I love to explore all aspects of ML (NLP, CV, statistics, deep learning and data engineering)
- **Traveling**: I was on a world tour in 2019, and I always love discovering new places
- **Sports**: hiking and fitness mostly, but used to play volleyball for a while as well as javelin
- **Animal**: plant-based since 5 years, and I'm more engaged that ever :)
- **Entrepreneurship**: I did several hackathons and contests, launched a startup during my Bachelor, and I'm now working on [SoundMap](http://soundmap.io/)

Regarding my background, here's what I have been doing before:
- B.Sc. in Economics, University of Lausanne (HEC Faculty), *Switzerland*
- M.Sc. in Actuarial Science (applied mathematics and statistics for the insurance sector), University of Lausanne (HEC Faculty), *Switzerland*
- MS in Data Science, Telecom Paris (Institut Polytechnique de Paris), *France*
- Ph.D. in Speech Processing, Idiap Research Institute (EPFL), *Switzerland*

I have also worked for various companies, either as an intern, a data scientist or a freelance contractor: [Anasen](https://anasen.com/) (NLP), [Veamly](https://veamly.com/) (NLP), [VivaData](https://vivadata.org/), (Instructor), [Stat4Decision](https://www.stat4decision.com/en/) (Instructor), [Dakar Insitute of Technology](https://dit.sn/) (Instructor). I also write content online for some companies ([Digital Minds](https://www.digitalminds.io/), [Explorium](https://www.explorium.ai/), [Stat4Decision](https://www.stat4decision.com/en/)), and on [Medium](https://medium.com/@mael.fabien).

I started this blog in September 2018 for several reasons:
- Writing helps me understand. Pictures and schemas too. I am trying to combine both in my articles.
- I did most of my studies in English, although it's not my native language. This blog is a way to keep practicing.
- Data Science is moving fast. Reading about AI-related news could be a full-time job. I learn best by doing projects. So I post most of them here.
- I forget stuff, so it's always good to have them written down in a single place.
- If this blog can help someone else, this really makes my day.

A list of cool things that happened since I started this blog:
- getting all of my freelance contracts
- getting some of my content features in US Universities :)
- getting several "thank you" emails each month, and this feels great
- getting invited to several podcasts
- launching a newsletter
- ...

You can [contact me](mailto:mael.fabien@gmail.com) if you have any question/remark (I try to answer all emails, and if I miss yours, feel free to remind me later). If you would like to get to know more about me and my projects, feel free to check out my [resume](https://maelfabien.github.io/assets/files/CV_MF.pdf). I'm uploading articles that I'm writing in my free time. I'm trying to upload several articles each month.

I recently launched a newsletter in which I gather some articles I wrote on a topic, interesting Github repositories, projects, papers and more! If you want to stay in the loop, I'll try to send 1 email per month :)

In this quick tutorial, we'll see how to use Google Drive as a file storage system when working in Google Colab.

## Mount Google Drive

The first step is to mount Google Drive on your Colab session :

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

Once you run the cell, a link is provided, similar to :
```Go to this URL in a browser: https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?client_id=XXX```

Open the URL. You should now see a page asking for access to the content of your Drive. Allow access.

## Check the content of your drive

Your drive is accessible through the folder  `drive/My Drive`. To check the content of this folder, run the following cell in your notebook :

```
!ls "drive/My Drive"
```

## Load a file from your drive

Your drive can now be used as a local folder ! For example :

```
X_train = np.load('drive/My Drive/X_train.npy')
```

Similarly, you can save your files as you would do locally.

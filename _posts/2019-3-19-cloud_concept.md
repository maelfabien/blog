In this series of articles, I'll present to you the main concepts of Cloud Computing as presented by AWS on their online certification: "Cloud Practitioner".

> **Cloud computing**  refers to the on-demand delivery of IT resources and applications via the Internet with Pay-As-You-Go pricing. 

It allows companies to avoid buying their infrastructures, in which case the would be subject to under or overuse. 

AWS can be :
- Initiated within seconds
- Treat these a temporary and disposable 
- Freeform the inflexibility and constraints
- More Agile and efficient

3 main factors influence agility :
- **Speed**
    -  Global reach within a moment’s notice
    - New resources a click away
- **Experimentation**
    - Experiment more often
    - Operations as code
    - Safely experiment
    - Spin up servers in minutes
    - Retour of re-purpose servers
    - Testing different configurations
    - AWS CloudFormation gives templated environments
- **Culture of innovation**
    - Experiment quickly with low cost/risk
    - Experiment more often

The AWS Infrastructure :
- Allows **elasticity, scalability and reliability** of computing resources
- Is distributed over regions: physical locations, containing multiple availability zones
- Availability zones (AZs): one or more discrete data centers, which offer power, networking, and connectivity in separate facilities

The AWS is highly available :
- Fault tolerance: Application operational during component failure, built-in redundancy of components
- Highly available: Systems always functioning and accessible. Downtime is minimized as much as possible, without human intervention. 

**Elasticity** is the power to scale computing resources up or down easily, while only paying for the actual resources used.

Elasticity allows customers to :
- Quickly deploy new applications
- Instantly scale up as the workload grows
- Instantly shut down resources that are no longer required
- Scale down and don’t pay for the infrastructure 

The overall infrastructure allows to :
- Use services at own pace
- Adapt consumption
- Launch new services or products
- Accommodate new strategic directions
- Run a wide range of applications
- Auto-scaling and elastic load balancing for scale up or down based on demand
- Deploy the system in multiple regions with lower latency and a better experience
- Innovative services and cutting-edge technology
- Virtually, support any workload

**Security** and compliance :
- Customer retains control over regions where data is located
- Security auditing often periodic and manual
- AWS cloud provides governance capabilities
- Industry-leading capabilities that meet the strictest security requirements

Data centers :
- Offer state of the art electronic surveillance
- Multi-factor access control systems
- Staffed 24x7
- Access is a strictly least-privileged basis 
- Environmental systems minimize the impact of disruptions
- Multiple regions and availability zones enable resiliency

**Reliability** is the ability of a system to recover from system failures. Also focused on the ability to dynamically acquire resources to meet demand and mitigate disruptions. 

A reliable system must have a well-planned foundation that can :
- Handle changes in demand
- Detect failure and automatically heal itself

**Pay as you go** pricing :
- Avoids dedicating resources to infrastructure
- Redirects focus on innovation and invention
- Reduces procurement complexity
- Enables elasticity
- Adapts to changes in business needs
- Improves responsiveness to changes
- Reduces the risk of over-provisioning or missing capacity

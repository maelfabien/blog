# Necessary packages

There are several packages that we will need for this training.

## MacOS

All you need to do is to install these packages via Homebrew. Homebrew is a package manager that helps install missing softwares on MacOs. The command line below installs Homebrek, zsh, wget, vim and git.

```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew update
brew install wget zsh vim git
```

## Ubuntu 

On Ubuntu, your installs can be made this way:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y make git zsh curl vim wget xclip
```

## Windows

Finally, on Windows, go to [Git's website](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and download git. You can follow [this tutorial](https://www.linode.com/docs/development/version-control/how-to-install-git-on-linux-mac-and-windows/). 

# Install Python

We then must install Python. There are many ways to install Python:
- from Python's website
- from Anaconda's website

Anaconda is a Python distribution which allows you to install Python as well as 400 core packages for data manipulation, visualization and machine learning.

Simply follow the installation guide [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).

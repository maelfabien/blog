The motivation behind the i-vector is to provide an intermediate representation between :
- high-dimensional GMM super-vector
- low-dimensional MFCC features

It models the total variability of both the speaker and the channel.

# I-vector feature extraction

I-vectors represent the GMM super-vector using a single total-variability subspace.

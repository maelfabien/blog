# If, Elif, Else

In Python, there is a really easy way to execute some code only if a certain condition is met, with an if-statement.

```python
var_a = 2
var_b = 5

if var_a + var_b > 0:
	print("Total is positive")
elif var_a + var_b == 0:
	print("Total is 0")
else:
	print("Total is negative")
```

This code will check for the condition that var_a plus var_b is greater than 0. If it is the case, we print that the total is positive.

At the second statement, we use the `elif` statement, meaning : "else, if this condition is met, do that...". Notice how to test for equality (and not assign a value), we do not use a single equal sign, but two. This is a simple thing to remember.

Finally, we use the `else` statement for any other case.

We could also have tested that the sum of both is greater or equal to 0.

```python
var_a = 2
var_b = 5

if var_a + var_b >= 0:
	print("Total is greater or equal to 0")
else:
	print("Total is negative")
```

The "greater or equal" sign is simply a greater sign, followed by a equal sign.

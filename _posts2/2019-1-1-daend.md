You have now finished the Data Analysis training, congratulations. If you submitted your assessment, you will soon get your certificate. This is the moment to leave a final review in the comments on the content of the course and the format. Don't hesitate to tell me what to improve, which content to add... For example, I am currently thinking of adding videos for some courses.

I sincerly hope you enjoyed the training. Please spread the word if you liked it, and move on to the Machine Learning training ;)

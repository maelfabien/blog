End of 2018, I started to look for an end of study internship in data science. After a first Master in Actuarial Science in Switzerland and an additional year of specialized Master in Big Data in France, I chose to apply to positions outside Europe mostly in order to get a real international experience.

I'll try to share my tips along the way, give you some statistics on my applications (answer rate, number of interviews, salary...)

## Applications

**Volumetry** : I've applied to 56 companies overall, some of which included Facebook, Apple, Amazon, but also much smaller companies and also a large amount of startups. 

**Geography** : Most of my applications were for positions outside Europe, especially in :
- USA 
- Australia
- Canada

The internships I've applied to were rather technical, often in some specific domains (e.g computer vision).

Among my 56 applications, I've had 2 offers, and kept 1 of them.

## Graphical Analysis

Let's first of all take a look at how I performed through the rounds of application :

I've received quite a lot

> **Conclusion** : I hope you enjoyed this quick tutorial on OpenPose for macOS. I am looking forward to making a more developped article on the field of pose recognition !

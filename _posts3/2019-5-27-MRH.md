Alternatively, instead of using HortonWorks Sandbox, we can execute MapReduce jobs locally. 

1) First of all, download the [Hadoop compressed file from Apache's website](http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/hadoop/common/hadoop-3.2.0/hadoop-3.2.0.tar.gz)

2) Unzip this file, and put it at your root: Users/yourname

3) Create a folder on your working directory (for example on your desktop). 

4) Create a short text file called `file.txt`

5) Test the Hadoop MapReduce utility by running the following command in your terminal :

```bash
mapred streaming -input Path-To-Input-File/file.txt -output Path-To-Input-File/Output -mapper /bin/cat -reducer /usr/bin/wc
```

If the MapReduce utility works correctly, you should have an output folder created, and 2 new files inside of it. 
If you have a problem, make sure you have the environment variable JAVA_HOME set (refer to Java SKD download).

6) To submit MapReduce Jobs, as previously, create 2 files: `mapper.py` and `reducer.py`.

`mapper.py` :

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
import sys
def main(argv):
    for line in sys.stdin:
        wordlist = line.strip().split()
        for word in wordlist:
            print(word+"\t"+"1")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main(sys.argv)
```

`reducer.py` :

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
import sys
def main(argv):
    current_word = None
    wordcount = 0
    for line in sys.stdin:
        word, n = line.strip().split("\t",1)
        n = int(n)
        if current_word == word:
            wordcount += n
        else:
            if current_word:
                print(current_word+"\t"+str(wordcount))
                wordcount = n
            current_word = word
            print(current_word+"\t"+str(wordcount))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main(sys.argv)
```

You should now be able to execute this MapReduce job with the following command :

```python
mapred streaming -input Path-To-Input-File/file.txt -output Path-To-Input-File/Output -mapper "python Path-To-Mapper/mapper.py" -reducer "python Path-To-Reducer/reducer.py"
```

I'm explicitly specifying the Python instruction to execute the mapper and reducer files to avoid access denial. 

You should now observe an output with 2 files: a Sucess file, and `part-0000` which contains the output of the WordCount.

> Conclusion: I hope this short tutorial was helpful. I'd be happy to answer any question you might have in the comments section.

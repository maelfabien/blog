## Course 1: Introduction to Natural Language Processing

[Introduction to Natural Language Processing](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/NLP_0/) : What is NLP ? What is it used for ?

[Text Preprocessing](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/NLP_1/) : Preprocessing in Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the process by which we try to "standardize" the text we want to analyze.

## Course 2: Core NLP Libraries

[Introduction to NLTK](): Todo

[Introduction to SpaCy](): Todo

## Course 3: Text Embedding

[Text Embedding with Bag-Of-Words and TF-IDF](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/NLP_2/) : In order to analyze text and run algorithms on it, we need to embed the text. The notion of embedding simply means that we'll conver the input text into a set of numerical vectors that can be used into algorithms. In this article, we'll cover BOW and TF-IDF, two simple techniques for embedding.

[Text Embedding with Word2Vec](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/NLP_3/) : A deeper dive into the state of the art embedding technique : Word2Vec.

[Data Augmentation in NLP](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/NLP_8/) : Details of the implementation of "Easy Data Augmentation" paper.

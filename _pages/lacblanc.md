You will start by parking in Argentières, near Chamonix. A few meters further, the walk begins and you quickly start to elevate.

After 45 minutes of walk, you start to visualize your target of the day, the summit of the mountain:

After a rather steep part, you get out of the forest and start a more rocky part of the hike.

This part is followed by a fun and more technical part, with ladders, which reminds me of Via Ferrata. Since we hiked on a nice day, several groups were there, so expect some waiting time to go through this section.

The last part of the hike, which lasts around 45 minutes, is completely different. Wind and snow will quickly make you feel cold. We finally reached the Lake of Chéserys and the Lac Blanc, and the effort was worth the view.

Expect 2.5 hours to go down, and make sure to grab a drink in the center of Argentières afterwards ! :)

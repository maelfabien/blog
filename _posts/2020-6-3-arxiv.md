# Why ArXiv?

I recently submitted my first conference paper. The paper is called "Speaker Identification Enhancement using Network Knowledge in Criminal Investigations", and you can find it [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02093) if you want.

I do not have the response of the conference yet. However, I decided to piublish the paper on ArXiv for several reasons:
- It touches a wider audience
- It contributes to making research open to all, and not only to those who pay subscriptions to some journals
- I read most of the papers on ArXiv, so it's cool to have mine there too :)

You should pay attention to the guidelines of the conference you published to. Some of them don't require anything, some of them want you to mention "Sumbitted to MYCONFERENCE" as a comment, and some of them forbid to publish it anywhere else while still in review.

# From OverLeaf to ArXiv

The process of submitting your first ArXiv paper might take longer than you expect. I though that uploading the PDF downloaded from OverLeaf would be enough, but no. ArXiv actually wants the source of your paper, including all of your figures, the .bib references files and the .tex file... 

Hopefully, if like me, you use Overleaf, there is this magix "Submit" button that will help:

So first thing first, you need to clean the files that you have in your project:
- remove **any** file that is not used
- if you use a PDF file at some point, include in your Tex document: ```\pdfoutput=1```
- correct any error in the logs and output files (you can however have warning, no problem with that)

Now, once you click on the Submit button, you can select "ArXiv.org", and then download the ZIP with submission files. You will end up with a ZIP file that you can now [upload to ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/help/submit).

Follow the procedure, and your paper will finally appear as submitted. A few hours/days later, it should be on ArXiv :)
